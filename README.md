# Tic-Tac-Toe-Logic-2-
# 🧠 Intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Logic-2)

## Overview
This project implements an intelligent Tic-Tac-Toe game using **Python** and a **rule-based Artificial Intelligence approach (Logic-2)**.  
The AI dynamically evaluates the board and makes decisions using predefined strategic rules instead of relying on stored move tables.

---

## AI Logic Used (Logic-2)
The AI follows a priority-based rule system:
1. Win if possible
2. Block opponent’s winning move
3. Take the center position
4. Take a corner position
5. Take any available side

This approach simulates **human-like reasoning** and decision-making.
